<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION  -->

# 📖 Morse Code Decoder <a name="about-project"></a>

The Morse code decoder is a Ruby program designed to translate Morse code messages into readable text. Morse code is a system of representing letters, numbers, and symbols using sequences of short and long signals, commonly referred to as dots and dashes.

The decoder program takes a Morse code message as input and processes it to identify the individual characters and their corresponding Morse code representations. It then maps these Morse code sequences to the appropriate alphabetical letters, numbers, or symbols based on the Morse code standard.

By running the decoder program, users can easily convert Morse code messages into human-readable text, allowing for efficient communication and understanding. The program provides a convenient tool for decoding Morse code in various scenarios, such as deciphering historical telegraph messages or practicing Morse code proficiency.

With its simplicity and effectiveness, the Morse code decoder program in Ruby serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in Morse code communication, cryptography, or exploring the rich history of telecommunication.
